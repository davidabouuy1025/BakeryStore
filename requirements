Bakery Store Website Assignment 🥐🎂
Objective:
Create a fully functional Bakery Store Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website should have multiple pages, interactive features, and a polished design. This project will help you practice structuring web pages, styling with CSS, and adding interactive elements using JavaScript.

📌 Project Requirements:
1️⃣ Homepage (index.html)
This is the main landing page of the bakery website. It should include:

✅ Navigation Bar

Links to Home, Menu, Contact, and About Us (Internal Links).

Styled with CSS (background color, hover effects).

✅ Hero Section

A large banner image showcasing the bakery.

A welcome headline and a short description about the bakery.

A "Learn More" button, which scrolls down to the About Us section (using JavaScript).

✅ About Us Section

A brief history of the bakery.

A few images of the shop and team.

✅ Special Offer Section

Displays a random daily special (e.g., “20% off Chocolate Cake today!”) using JavaScript.

✅ Call-to-Action (CTA)

A button saying "Visit Our Menu", which takes users to the Menu page.

2️⃣ Menu Page (menu.html)
The menu page should display available bakery items in an organized layout.

✅ Grid Layout of Menu Items

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to arrange items neatly.

Each item should have:

An image of the item (e.g., a cupcake, croissant, bread).

A name and a brief description.

A price.

✅ Favorite Feature (JavaScript)

Clicking on an item will toggle a favorite heart ❤️ (changes color when selected).

Use JavaScript to store favorite items in local storage so they remain selected even if the page is refreshed.

✅ Filter/Search Option (JavaScript)

A search bar at the top to filter items based on names (e.g., searching “cake” only shows cake-related items).

A button to show "Only Favorites" items.

3️⃣ Contact Page (contact.html)
This page will allow customers to contact the bakery.

✅ Contact Form

Fields: Name, Email, Phone, and Message

The form should be styled properly with padding and borders.

The Submit button should be styled and interactive.

✅ Form Validation (JavaScript)

Ensure that all fields are filled out before submission.

Show an error message if any field is empty.

Validate that the email is in the correct format.

Display a success message when the form is submitted successfully.

✅ Google Maps Integration (Bonus)

Embed a Google Map showing the bakery’s location.

4️⃣ CSS Styling (style.css)
The website should have a consistent and appealing design using an external CSS file.

✅ Color Scheme & Fonts

Use warm colors like beige, brown, and cream to match the bakery theme.

Use Google Fonts (e.g., "Poppins" or "Cursive") for a bakery-like feel.

✅ Navigation Bar Styling

Background color

Hover effects on links

✅ Responsive Design

The website should look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Use media queries to adjust layout for different screen sizes.

✅ Hover Effects

Menu items should zoom in slightly on hover.

Buttons should have a slight color change when hovered.

5️⃣ JavaScript (script.js)
Add interactivity to the website using JavaScript.

✅ Welcome Alert on Homepage

When the page loads, show a greeting message (e.g., “Welcome to Delicious Bakery! 🍰”).

✅ Smooth Scrolling for "Learn More" Button

Clicking the button smoothly scrolls down to the About Us section.

✅ Random Daily Special

Use JavaScript to display a different special offer each time the page loads.

✅ Favorite Items Feature

Clicking the heart ❤️ on a menu item toggles its favorite status.

Save favorite items to local storage so they persist after a page refresh.

✅ Search & Filter Functionality

The search bar dynamically filters menu items based on the user’s input.

The "Only Favorites" button filters and shows only favorite items.

✅ Form Validation

Ensure all fields are filled correctly before submission.

Show error messages if there are missing fields.
